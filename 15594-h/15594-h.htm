    <p>CURRAN, the celebrated Irish Patriot, was a man of intense
    wit and humour. On one occasion he was discussing with RICHARD
    BRINSLEY SHERIDAN the possibility of combining the interests of
    the two countries under one Crown. "It is a difficult matter to
    arrange," observed the brilliant author of the <i>School for
    Scandal</i>, "Right you are, darlint," acquiesced CURRAN, with
    the least taste of a brogue. "But where are ye to find the
    spalpeens for it? Ye may wake so poor a creature as a sow, but
    it takes a real gintleman to raise the rint!" Then, with a
    twinkle in his eyes, "But, for all that, ma cruiskeen, I'm not
    meself at all at all!"</p>

    <h2>SWORD AND PEN;</h2>

    <h3 class="sc">Or, The Rival Commanders.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>Extract from a Military Story of the near
    Future.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Captain Pipeclay was perplexed when his Company refused to
    obey him. He was considered a fairly good soldier, but not up
    to date. He might know his drill, he might have read his
    <i>Queen's Regulations</i>, but he had vague ideas of the power
    of the Press.</p>

    <p>"You see, Sir," remonstrated his Colour-Sergeant; "if the
    rear rank think they should stand fast when you give the
    command 'Open order!' it is only a matter of opinion. You may
    be right, or you may be wrong. Speaking for myself, I am
    inclined to fancy that the men are making a mistake; but you
    can't always consider yourself omniscient."</p>

    <p>"Sergeant," returned the officer, harshly; "it is not the
    business of men to argue, but to obey."</p>

    <p>"Pardon me again, Sir, but isn't that slightly
    old-fashioned? I know that theoretically you have reason on
    your side; but then in these days of the latter end of the
    nineteenth century, we must not he bound too tightly to
    precedent."</p>

    <p>The Captain bit his moustache for the fourth time, and then
    again gave the order. But there was no response. The Company
    moved not a muscle.</p>

    <p>"This is mutiny!" cried the officer. "I will break everyone
    of you. I will put you all in the cells; and in the orderly
    room to-morrow morning, we will soon see if there is such a
    thing as discipline."</p>

    <p>"Discipline!" repeated the Sergeant. "Beg your pardon, Sir,
    but I don't think the men understand what you mean. The word is
    not to be found in the most recent dictionaries."</p>

    <p>And certainly things seemed to be reaching a climax, for
    however much the Commander might shout, not one of the rank and
    file stirred an inch. It was at this moment that a cloaked
    figure approached the parade-ground. The new-comer strode about
    with a bearing that suggested one accustomed to receive
    obedience.</p>

    <p>"What is the matter?" asked the Disguised One.</p>

    <p>"I can't get my men to obey me," explained the Captain. "I
    have been desiring them to take open order for the last ten
    minutes, and they remain as they were."</p>

    <p>"What have they to say in their defence?" was the inquiry of
    the Man in the Cloak.</p>

    <p>"He won't let us write to the newspapers!" was heard from
    the ranks.</p>

    <p>"Is this really so?" asked the new-comer, in a tone more of
    sorrow than of anger.</p>

    <p>"Well, Sir," returned the Captain, "as it is a rule of the
    Service that no communications shall be sent to the Press, I
    thought that&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You had no right to think, Sir!" was the sharp reply. "Are
    you so ignorant that you do not know that it is a birth-right
    of a true-born Briton to air his opinions in the organs of
    publicity? You will allow the men to go to their quarters at
    once, that they may state their grievances on paper. They are
    at perfect liberty to write what they please, and they may rest
    assured that their communications will escape the grave of the
    waste-paper basket."</p>

    <p>Thus encouraged, the Company dismissed without further word
    of command.</p>

    <p>"And who may you be?" asked the Captain, with some
    bitterness. "Are you the Commander-in-Chief?"</p>

    <p>"I am one infinitely more powerful," was the reply. And then
    the speaker threw off his disguise-cloak, and appeared in
    morning-dress. "Behold in me the Editor of an influential
    Journal!"</p>

    <p>A week later the Captain had sent in his papers, and every
    man in the Company he had once commanded wore the stripe of a
    Lance Corporal. And thus was the power of the Press once again
    sufficiently vindicated.</p>

    <h2>"IN A WINTER (COVENT) GARDEN."</h2>

    <p>That indefatigable Showman, Sir DRURIOLANUS, the Invincible
    Knight, commenced his Winter Operatic Season on Monday, the
    Tenth, at Covent Garden, so as to be well in advance of Signor
    LAGO, who may now boast of having <i>La Donna</i>, Her Most
    Gracious MAJESTY, for his patron.</p>

    <p><i>Monday Night</i>.&mdash;The two RAVOGLIS in good form in
    the <i>Orféo.</i> Likewise the Player of the Big Drum made more
    than one big hit during the evening. "<i>Che farò</i>" was
    re-demanded. "Tired of '<i>Faro</i>,'" quoth Mr.
    WAGGSTAFF&mdash;"why not make it '<i>Whisto</i>,' or some other
    game?" <i>Exit</i> WAGGY. The <i>Intermezzo</i> of
    <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> of course encored enthusiastically.
    "Signor CREMONNINI," quoth WAGG, returning, "is not half the
    'ninny' his name implies." And, indeed, from the moment he was
    heard singing "in his ambush" (as the Irish boy in the Gallery
    said of TOM HOHLER at the Dublin Theatre when he heard the
    <i>Trovatore's</i> voice behind the scenes) before the rise of
    the Curtain, everyone said, "This is the tenner for our
    money."</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;The namesake of our own GEORGE
    AUGUSTUS, Mlle. ROSITA SALA, made a real hit as <i>Leonora</i>
    in <i>Il Trovatore</i>. "Handsome is as handsome does," and
    Mlle. SALA didn't act as "handsome" as she looked. Another
    "ninny" played to-night, namely GIANNINNI, all right vocally,
    but not much dramatically. "<i>Il Balen</i>" was encored when
    sung by a manly baritone with the feminine name of ANNA;
    <i>i.e.</i>, Signor DE ANNA. He might advantageously alter
    DE-ANNA to APOLLO, that is if he could be sure of looking the
    part.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;<i>Lohengrin</i>. MELBA as
    <i>Elsa</i>. WAGGSTAFF tried to make his usual pun on the name
    of <i>Ortruda</i>, but was "countered" by Young JUMPER who
    protested that he had heard it before and never wanted to hear
    it again. "I know what you're going to say," he exclaimed;
    "it's something about '<i>aught ruder</i>!' I know!" "I've no
    doubt you do," returned the defrauded WAGGY, sarcastically,
    "for you're uncommonly like <i>Othello</i>, 'Rude am I in
    speech'&mdash;only," added WAGGSTAFF, "<i>he</i> apologised for
    it." Young JUMPER sniggered, his friends laughed, and the
    incident terminated. The Chorus seemed to have become Wandering
    Minstrels, so very uncertain were they.</p>

    <p>Altogether, Sir DRURIOLANUS OPERATICUS, with his successful
    Drury Lane Race-course, his Provincial Theatre, his Italian
    Opera, his Paper (not <i>in</i> the House, but his weekly one
    out of it), his Music-of-the-Future Hall, for which a temporary
    and limited licence has been granted, will&mdash;in a
    general-dealer kind of way&mdash;be having a good time of it
    till Pantomime Season slaps him on the back with a cheery "Here
    we are again!" and then he will have another and a better time.

    <p>A Gentleman must be liberal, not to say lavish, to servants,
    porters, gamekeepers, and others, or he is "no gent." At the
    same time the Perfect Gentleman is never extravagant.</p>

    <p>He must not work. At the same time he must not be an
    idler.</p>

    <p>He is known by his scrupulous attention to the minutiæ of
    personal appearance, while "despising all outside show."</p>

    <p>The Perfect Gentleman "never wilfully hurts anybody." No
    soldier, doctor, or schoolmaster can, therefore, ever be a
    P.G.</p>

    <p>He is always perfectly open and frank. He is also
    sufficiently artful to conceal the fact that he considers the
    person he is talking to a mixture of a snob and a
    blockhead.</p>

    <p>When his favourite corn is trodden on by a weighty stranger,
    he never utters any expression stronger than "Dear me!"</p>

    <p>He never loses his temper.</p>

    <p>He must know how to treat everyone according to their rank
    and situation in life, but show special courtesy to those who
    are his inferiors.</p>

    <p>He must be well-born, although there are plenty of "Nature's
    Gentlemen" in the ranks of day-labourers.</p>

    <p>He must be sufficiently wealthy to keep up a good position,
    while recognising the fact that money has nothing to do with
    true gentility.</p>

    <p>He should also try and remember that no such jumble of
    contradictions as the Perfect Gentleman ever existed.</p>

    <h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS TO YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Grouse in the Gun-room.</i>)</h4>

    <p>And, next, my gallant young Sportsmen, just sharpen up your
    attention, and, if you have ears, prepare to lend them now. Be,
    in fact, all ears. At any rate, get yourselves as near as
    possible to that desirable condition, for we are going to
    discuss shooting-lunches, and all that pertains to them. Think
    of it! Are not some of your happiest memories, and your most
    delightful anticipations, bound up with the mid-day meal, at
    which the anxieties and disappointments of the morning, the
    birds you missed, the birds that, though they got up in front
    of you, were shot by your jealous neighbour, the wiped-eyes,
    the hands torn in the thorn-bushes, at which, as I say, all
    these are forgotten, when you lay aside your gun, and sit down
    to your short repose. Then it is that the talker shines
    supreme. All the conversation which may have been broken in
    upon during the morning by the necessity for posting yourself
    at the hot corner, or the grassy ride, or in the butt, or for
    polishing off a right and left of partridges, can then flow
    free and uninterrupted. Ah, happy moments, when the bad shot
    becomes as the good, and all distinctions are levelled! How
    well, how gratefully do I remember you! Still, in my waking
    fancies, there rises to my nose a savoury odour, telling of
    stew or hot-pot, and still the crisp succulence of the jam
    tartlet has honour in my memory. Ah, <i>tempi passati, tempi
    passati</i>! But away, fancy, and to our work, which is to
    speak of</p>

    <h3 class="sc">Shooting-Lunches</h3>

    <p>in their relation to talk:&mdash;</p>

    <p>(1.) Be extremely careful, unless you know exactly the ways
    of your host with regard to his shooting-lunch, not to express
    to him before lunch any very definite opinion as to what the
    best kind of lunch is. If, for instance, you rashly declare
    that, for your own part, you detest a solemn
    sit-down-in-a-farmhouse lunch, and that your ideal is a
    sandwich, a biscuit and a nip out of a flask, and if you then
    find yourself lunching off three courses at a comfortable
    table, why you'll be in a bit of a hole. Consistency would
    prompt you to abstain, appetite urges you to eat. What is a
    poor talker to do? Obviously, he must get out somehow. Here is
    a suggested method. Begin by admiring the room.</p>

    <p>"By Jove, what a jolly little room this is. It's as spick
    and span as a model dairy. I wish you'd take me on as your
    tenant, CHALMERS, when you've got a vacancy."</p>

    <p>CHALMERS will say, "It's not a bad little hole. Old Mrs.
    NUBBLES keeps things wonderfully spruce. This is one of the
    cottages I built five years ago."</p>

    <p>There's your first move. Your next is as follows. Every
    rustic-cottage contains gruesome china-ornaments and
    excruciating-cheap German-prints of such subjects as "<i>The
    Tryst</i>" (always spelt "<i>The Trist</i>" on the German
    print), "<i>The Saylor's Return," "The Warior's Dreem</i>,"
    "<i>Napoleon at Arcola</i>," and so forth. Point to a
    china-ornament and say, "I never knew cows in this part of the
    country were blue and green." Then after you've exhausted the
    cow, milked her dry, so to speak, you can take a turn at the
    engravings, and make a sly hit at the taste in art generated by
    modern education. Hereupon, someone is dead certain to chime in
    with the veteran grumble about farmers who educate their
    children above their station by allowing their daughters to
    learn to play the piano, and their sons to acquire the
    rudiments of Latin: "Give you my word of honour, the farmers'
    daughters about my uncle's place, get their dresses made by my
    aunt's dressmaker, and thump out old WAGNER all day long." This
    horrible picture of rural depravity will cause an animated
    discussion. When it is over, you can say, "This is the very
    best Irish-stew I've ever tasted. I must get your cook to give
    me the receipt."</p>

    <p>"Ah, my boy," says CHALMERS, "you'll find there's nothing
    like a stew out shooting."</p>

    <p>"Of course," you say, "nothing can beat it, if you've got a
    nice room to eat it in, and aren't pressed for time; but, if
    you've got no end of ground to cover, and not much time to do
    it in, I can always manage to do myself on a scrap of anything
    handy. Thanks, I don't mind if I do have a chunk of cake, and a
    whitewash of sherry."</p>

    <p>Thus you have fetched a compass&mdash;I fancy the phrase is
    correct&mdash;and have wiped out the memory of your
    indiscretion. Of course the thing may happen the other way
    round. You may have expressed a preference for solid lunches,
    only to find yourself set down on a tuft of grass, with a beef
    sandwich and a digestive biscuit. In that case you can begin by
    declaring your delight in an open-air meal, go on to admire the
    scenery, and end by expressing a certain amount of judicious
    contempt for the Sybarite who cannot tear himself away from
    effeminate luxuries, and the trick's done.</p>

    <p>But this subject is so great, and has so many varieties,
    that we must recur to it in our next.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Your marvellous judgment in the
    selection of your "staff"&mdash;(I believe that is the correct
    term to use in speaking of those who write for the paper,
    though as a rule a staff is <i>wooden-headed</i>, which I am
    sure none of your contributors are!&mdash;I can answer for
    <i>one</i>!)&mdash;has again placed you in the position envied
    of all Journals, viz.,&mdash;(<i>why</i> do people put "viz.,"
    and not "namely"?&mdash;it <i>is</i> silly!) that of affording
    "information" given by no other Journal! All of which preamble
    means,&mdash;(by the way, why "pre-<i>amble</i>"?&mdash;if one
    is a speedy writer, why not "pre-<i>canter</i>"?)&mdash;that
    <i>Punch</i>, in the person of LADY GAY&mdash;(that <i>may</i>
    seem a little mixed, but it isn't)&mdash;was the <i>only</i>
    Sporting Paper which tipped the winner of the Cesarewitch!</p>

    <p>For confirmation of this I refer the sceptical to my last
    week's letter, in which I stated that in dreaming of the race I
    dreamt that "<i>Burnaby came to the rescue</i>"&mdash;and if
    this is not giving the winner, I should like to know what is!
    It is true I made <i>Brandy</i> my "verse selection," but that
    would only mislead the people who go no further than the
    surface (not of the brandy), as anyone who gave the matter a
    moment's thought would realise that Brandy is always applied
    <i>after</i> a rescue! I hear there was a "ton of money" for
    the winner just before the start, but I did not see anyone
    carrying it about, so I suppose it was what they call "covering
    money," which, I presume, is covered over for safety, as it
    would be risky to walk about a race-course with a ton of loose
    money&mdash;not that I suppose anyone who goes racing would
    touch it, but it <i>might</i> be lost! Anyhow, there was a ton
    of money for the winner <i>after</i> the race, which his owner
    <i>had</i> to take, willy-nilly, or HOBSON's choice!</p>

    <p>The pleasantest feature of the meeting, however, was the
    re-appearance of H.R.H. the Prince of WALES, which was also
    pleasantly marked by one of his horses winning a race! The
    Public having anxiously "watched" for H.R.H., the success of
    <i>The Vigil</i> was received with enthusiasm!</p>

    <p>Next week takes us to Gatwick and Sandown&mdash;(or rather
    the <i>train</i> takes us&mdash;another absurd
    expression)&mdash;the last day of the latter Meeting being
    devoted to "Jumping Races," which is the contemptuous way some
    people speak of the winter branch of our National
    Sport!&mdash;forgetting that it demands the two most desirable
    qualities in a horse, <i>speed and endurance</i>&mdash;whereas
    the modern flat-racing has degenerated, for the most part, into
    scrambles and gambles, where <i>speed</i> is the only
    requisite!&mdash;but more of this anon&mdash;but <i>not</i>
    anonymous, as I believe in signed articles, as the apprentice
    said! (<i>Not</i> BRADFORD!)</p>

    <p>The most important race at Gatwick&mdash;(<i>delightful</i>
    place to go racing&mdash;lots of room to move about
    in)&mdash;is the Thousand Pound Handicap, in which race
    <i>Brandy</i> is worth keeping an eye on, as she ought to beat
    <i>Burnaby</i> at the difference in the weights&mdash;other
    horses that might make their mark during the
    week&mdash;(especially now the ground is soft)&mdash;are,
    <i>Pilot, Golden Garter</i>&mdash;(<i>I</i> never was guilty of
    such extravagance as that)&mdash;<i>Queen of
    Navarre</i>&mdash;(<i>she</i> might have been)&mdash;<i>Meadow
    Brown</i>, <i>Terror</i>, and <i>Seawall</i>, the last three in
    the "Jumping Races"&mdash;and, in conclusion, the inevitable
    rhythmical winner, from</p>

    <h4>(<i>From a Collection of Communications supplied by our
    Prophetic Compiler.</i>)</h4>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Pray protect the Griffin! Those Goths
    and Vandals, the Members of the Corporation of the City of
    London, will remove it, unless you intervene. This beautiful
    work of Art, that stands on the supposed site of the mythical
    Temple Bar, is to come down. What would our ancestors say if
    they were here? Would they not frown at their degenerate
    descendants? Every student of history knows that this Griffin
    was put up by universal consent, and considered one of the
    finest works of art of the nineteenth century. As, indeed, it
    was. It is full of historic memories. It was here that
    WELLINGTON met NAPOLEON after Waterloo; and here, again, was
    the Volunteer Movement inaugurated, when Mr. Alderman WAT
    TYLER, putting himself at the head of the citizens, called for
    "Three cheers for the Charter and the Anti-Corn-Law League!"
    The beautiful bas-reliefs that used to represent the occasions
    have disappeared, but their subjects are tenderly cherished. If
    the Corporation <i>must</i> pull down something, let them
    destroy the recently-erected Mansion House! but spare, oh
    spare, the Griffin!</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;It is time for a protest! One of the
    most beautiful erections of the nineteenth century (the old
    South Kensington Railway Station of the District Railway) is to
    be removed! Instead of the picturesque iron roof, we are to
    have some abomination in stone! Can this be? It is said to be
    falling to pieces under the ravages of Time. If this be really
    the case, why not let it be restored? There was no more
    picturesque outcome from the nineteenth century than these
    pretty arrangements in metal. The last generation swept them
    away by scores, by hundreds, by thousands&mdash;they did not
    even spare the Brompton Boilers! Let not such a reproach be
    applicable to us. We pride ourselves upon our love of Art and
    veneration for the antique and the beautiful, and yet we would
    pull down a building that for a century has been the admiration
    of all with a soul for Art and a mind for appreciating the
    sublimest efforts of genius in its highest sense! This must not
    be.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
